# TheaterReservationSystem
In this project, you are going to implement a theater ticket reservation system simulation. This program will be run as multi-threaded by considering synchronization and data consistency issues. The scenario of the simulation is that the clients arrive at the ticket office for seat reservation and tellers reserve the seats for them.
