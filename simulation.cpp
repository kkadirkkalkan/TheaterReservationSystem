 *
 * There is a make "Makefile" file in the project folder. This code can be compiled with this file. When "make" is written to the shell this code will be compiled.
 * Then in order to run this code you need to use this command "./simulation.o configuration_path output_path" . configuration_path is the path of the input file
 * and output_path is the path of the outputfile. The code will create an outputfile and write the output into this file.
 * (Ex run: ./simulation.o ./configuration_file_5.txt ./OutputFile.txt )
